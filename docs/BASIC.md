## Asymptotic analysis

- Best Case
- Average Case
- Worst Case
- Ο Notation: BigO, running time for the worst case 
- Ω Notation: the lower bound of an algorithm's running time
- θ Notation: both the lower bound and the upper bound of an algorithm's running time

## Stack

- Expression Parsing

```
Step 1 − scan the expression from left to right 
Step 2 − if it is an operand push it to stack 
Step 3 − if it is an operator pull operand from stack and perform operation 
Step 4 − store the output of step 3, back to stack 
Step 5 − scan the expression until all operands are consumed 
Step 6 − pop the stack and perform operation
```

## Hash Table
